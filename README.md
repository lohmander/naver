# Naver translator as a CLI

Quick and dirty cli for interacting with the Naver translator (KO -> EN -> KO).

Just pulled the "passportKey" from the network logger, so it will probably expire at
some point.

## Usage

```sh
$ naver en "Hello"
안녕하세요.
```

```sh
$ naver ko "뭐헤?"
What are you doing?
```
